- **15 minutes** for installation and your first screening

---

## Step 1: Install the Toolkit (One-Time Setup)

### üìÅ Understanding the Folder Structure

The toolkit needs files organized in a specific way. Here's what it looks like:

```
universal-literature-screening-toolkit/     ‚Üê Main folder (you downloaded this)
‚îú‚îÄ input_pdfs/                              ‚Üê Put your PDF files here (you'll create this)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ paper1.pdf                           ‚Üê Your PDF files (any names are fine)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ paper2.pdf
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ paper3.pdf
‚îú‚îÄ query.txt                                ‚Üê Your search query (you'll create this)
‚îú‚îÄ scripts/                                 ‚Üê Helper programs (already included)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ setup_windows.ps1
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ run_tool.ps1
‚îî‚îÄ run_screening.py                         ‚Üê Main program (already included)
```

**Important to know:**
- ‚úÖ Your **PDF files can have any names** you want
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The **folder `input_pdfs` must be named exactly** that (lowercase, with underscore)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The **query file must be named** `query.txt` (unless you specify otherwise)
- üìç Everything must be in the same location as `run_screening.py`

### ü™ü Windows Installation

**What is PowerShell?** It's a command-line tool built into Windows. Don't worry‚Äîyou just need to copy and paste a few commands!

**Step 1: Open PowerShell**

- Press `Windows Key + X` on your keyboard
- Click "Windows PowerShell" or "Terminal"
- A blue or black window will open

**Step 2: Go to the Toolkit Folder**

```powershell
# Replace "YourName" with your actual Windows username
# Replace the path if you put the toolkit somewhere else
cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\universal-literature-screening-toolkit
```

**Tip:** If you don't know where you unzipped the toolkit, right-click the folder in File Explorer and select "Copy as path", then paste it after `cd `.

**Step 3: Allow PowerShell to Run the Installer**

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

**What does this do?** Windows blocks scripts for security by default. This command allows scripts to run in this PowerShell window only‚Äîit's safe and doesn't change your computer's security settings permanently.

**Step 4: Run the Installer**

```powershell
.\scripts\setup_windows.ps1
```

**What happens now?** The script will:
- Check if Python is installed (and help you install it if needed)
- Create a safe, isolated environment for the toolkit
- Install all required software libraries
- Take 2-3 minutes to complete

**Step 5: Verify Everything Works**

```powershell
.\scripts\run_tests.ps1
```

**Success looks like:** You'll see `‚úÖ All tests passed successfully!`

**If you see warnings:** Don't worry! Warnings (in yellow) are not errors. As long as you see "All tests passed", everything is working correctly.

**If something goes wrong:** See the [Troubleshooting section](USER_GUIDE.md#troubleshooting) in the User Guide, or check the [FAQ](USER_GUIDE.md#frequently-asked-questions).

### üçé macOS / üêß Linux Installation

**What is Terminal?** It's the command-line tool for Mac and Linux. You'll use it to run a few simple commands.

**Step 1: Open Terminal**

- **macOS:** Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter
- **Linux:** Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

**Step 2: Go to the Toolkit Folder**

```bash
# Replace with the actual path where you unzipped the toolkit
cd ~/Downloads/universal-literature-screening-toolkit
```

**Step 3: Make the Installer Executable**

```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup_unix.sh scripts/run_tool.sh scripts/run_tests.sh
```

**What does this do?** This tells your computer that these files are programs that can be run.

**Step 4: Run the Installer**

```bash
./scripts/setup_unix.sh
```

**Step 5: Verify Everything Works**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests -q
```

**Success looks like:** You'll see messages saying tests passed.

## Step 2: Prepare Your Research Papers

### Create the Input Folder

You need to create a folder called `input_pdfs` where you'll put all the research papers you want to screen.

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Make sure you're still in the toolkit directory
# If you closed PowerShell, repeat Step 2 from above

New-Item -ItemType Directory -Name "input_pdfs" -Force
```

**macOS/Linux (Terminal):**
```bash
mkdir -p input_pdfs
```

**Or use your File Explorer/Finder:** You can also just create a new folder called `input_pdfs` using your normal file browser‚Äîjust make sure it's inside the toolkit folder!

### Copy Your PDF Files

Now, copy all the research papers (PDF files) you want to screen into the `input_pdfs` folder.

**Important rules:**
- ‚úÖ Put all PDFs **directly in the `input_pdfs` folder**
- ‚ùå Don't create subfolders inside `input_pdfs`
- ‚úÖ File names don't matter‚Äîname them however you like

**Example of a correct setup:**
```
input_pdfs/
‚îú‚îÄ Smith_2020_climate_change.pdf
‚îú‚îÄ Jones_forest_management.pdf
‚îú‚îÄ my_important_paper.pdf
‚îî‚îÄ study_from_2023.pdf
```

---

## Step 3: Create Your Search Query

### What is a Search Query?

A search query tells the toolkit which papers to include or exclude. It's like a Google search, but more precise.

**Think of it this way:**
- "Show me papers about **forests** AND **management**"
- "Include papers about **climate** OR **weather**"
- "Exclude papers about **economics**"

### Create the Query File

**Step 1: Open a text editor**

- **Windows:** Open Notepad (search for it in the Start Menu)
- **macOS:** Open TextEdit
- **Linux:** Open gedit or your preferred text editor

**Step 2: Write your query**

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```
# My first literature screening query
# Lines starting with # are comments and won't affect the search

forest* AND climate*
```

This query will find papers that mention both "forest" (or forests, forestry, etc.) AND "climate" (or climatic, etc.)

**Step 3: Save the file**

- Save it as `query.txt` in the toolkit folder (same place as `run_screening.py`)
- **Windows users:** Make sure it's saved as `query.txt`, not `query.txt.txt`!

### Query Syntax Quick Reference

**Wildcards (`*`):** Match variations of a word
- `forest*` matches: forest, forests, forestry, forestation, forester

**Exact phrases (`"quotes"`):** Match multi-word terms exactly
- `"climate change"` matches only "climate change", not "climate" alone

**Combining terms:**
- `AND` = both terms must be in the paper
- `OR` = at least one term must be in the paper
- `NOT` = exclude papers with this term

**Grouping (`parentheses`):** Control the logic
- `(forest* OR woodland*) AND climate*` means: (forest OR woodland) AND climate

### Example Queries

**Basic search:**
```
forest* AND management
```

**More flexible:**
```
(forest* OR woodland* OR tree*) AND (management OR planning)
```

**With exclusions:**
```
forest* AND management AND NOT economics
```

**Complex search:**
```
# Find papers about forests with ecosystem services, excluding economic studies
(forest* OR woodland*) AND ("ecosystem service*" OR biodiversity) AND NOT (economics OR cost*)
```

**üí° Tip:** Start with a simple query first. You can always refine it after seeing the results!

---

## Step 4: Run the Tool

Now you're ready to screen your papers! The toolkit will read all your PDFs, check each one against your query, and organize the results.

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# If you closed PowerShell, open it again and navigate to the toolkit folder:
# cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\universal-literature-screening-toolkit

# Run the screening
.\scripts\run_tool.ps1 -QueryFile "query.txt"
```

**What you'll see:** Messages like "Processing papers..." and "Extracted text from paper1.pdf". This is normal!

### macOS/Linux (Terminal)

```bash
# If you closed Terminal, open it again and navigate to the toolkit folder

# Run the screening
./scripts/run_tool.sh --query-file "query.txt"
```

### Alternative: Direct Python Command (All Platforms)

```bash
python run_screening.py --input input_pdfs --output results --query-file query.txt
```

### What Happens During Screening?

The toolkit will:
1. Read text from each PDF file (~1-2 seconds per paper)
2. Check if the text matches your query
3. Create a detailed report
4. Sort papers into "include" and "exclude" folders

**How long does it take?** About 1-2 seconds per PDF. So 50 papers = ~1-2 minutes total.

---

## Step 5: Review Your Results

After the screening completes, you'll find a new `results` folder with all your screening results!

### What's in the Results Folder?

```
results/
‚îú‚îÄ validation_report.html      ‚Üê Open this in your web browser!
‚îú‚îÄ validation_results.json     ‚Üê Raw data (for advanced users)
‚îî‚îÄ sorted_pdfs/
   ‚îú‚îÄ include/                 ‚Üê Papers that matched your query
   ‚îî‚îÄ exclude/                 ‚Üê Papers that didn't match
```

### Understanding the HTML Report

**Double-click `validation_report.html`** to open it in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari‚Äîany browser works).

The report shows:

**1. Summary Statistics**
```
Total Papers: 50
‚úÖ Included: 12 (24%)
‚ùå Excluded: 38 (76%)
```

**2. Detailed Results Table**
- Lists every paper that was included
- Shows which search terms matched
- Displays text snippets from the paper showing the matches

**3. Your Query**
- Shows exactly what query was used
- Helps you remember your search criteria

### What to Do Next

1. **Open the HTML report** to see your results
2. **Check the included papers** in `results/sorted_pdfs/include/`
3. **Manually review** a few papers to confirm they're relevant
4. **Refine if needed:** If too many or too few papers matched, adjust your query and run again

**üí° Pro Tip**: The toolkit works best when you iterate! Start broad, review results, refine your query, and run again. This is exactly how expert screeners work - the tool just makes it 100x faster.

**Important:** Automated screening is just the first step! You should always manually review the included papers to make your final inclusion decisions.

## Try an Example

We've included a sample query file you can try right away to see how the toolkit works!

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\scripts\run_tool.ps1 -InputPath "input_pdfs" -OutputPath "example_results" -QueryFile "examples\query.txt"
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
./scripts/run_tool.sh --input "input_pdfs" --output "example_results" --query-file "examples/query.txt"
```

This will create a separate `example_results` folder so you can see how the output looks without affecting your main results.

### Pro Tips

**üí° Iterate your query:** Most researchers run screening 2-3 times with different queries before finding the right balance. Start broad, review results, then make it more specific.

**üí° Test with known papers:** If you have 5-10 papers you know should be included, run your query and check if they match. If not, adjust your query.

**üí° Document your process:** Keep notes on your queries and results. This is important for the "Methods" section of your systematic review paper.
