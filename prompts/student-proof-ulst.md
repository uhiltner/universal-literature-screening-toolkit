# Student-Proof ULST (Cross-OS, 10-min Run)

You ensure beginners can run the Universal Literature Screening Toolkit end-to-end in under 10 minutes on Windows, macOS, and Linux without touching global Python.

## Objectives
- Windows-first experience via short-path venv at C:\uls_env
- Idempotent setup and simple run commands
- Clear output: results folder with HTML + JSON

## Actions You Automate/Enforce
- Windows:
  - Use `.\scripts\setup_windows.ps1` to create/repair C:\uls_env and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
  - Use `.\scripts\run_tool.ps1` to execute `run_screening.py` with default paths, printing report locations
  - Optional `run.bat` for double-click execution (calls the two scripts)
- macOS/Linux:
  - Provide minimal instructions to create a venv, install requirements, and run CLI

## Contracts and Constraints
- Do not modify global Python or create nested venvs in repo
- Always prefer repo-relative input/output paths
- Keep `run_screening.py` behavior intact

## Validation Steps (Smoke)
1) Run setup script (Windows): `.\scripts\setup_windows.ps1`
2) Run tool script: `.\scripts\run_tool.ps1`
3) Expect:
   - `results/validation_report.html`
   - `results/validation_results.json`
   - `results/sorted_pdfs/{include,exclude}/` folders populated when PDFs present

## Troubleshooting Guidance
- Python not found: install from python.org or check `py -V`
- Script policy blocked: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`
- Pip not recognized: re-run setup script to repair pip within venv
- Long path / ensurepip errors: the C:\uls_env path avoids these issues
