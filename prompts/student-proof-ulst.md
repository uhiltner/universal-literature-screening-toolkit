# Student-Proof ULST (Cross-OS, 10-min Run)

You ensure beginners can run the Universal Literature Screening Toolkit end-to-end in under 10 minutes on Windows, macOS, and Linux without touching global Python.

## Objectives
- Windows-first experience via short-path venv at C:\uls_env
- macOS/Linux support via ~/.uls_env
- Idempotent setup and simple run commands
- Clear output: results folder with HTML + JSON

## Actions You Automate/Enforce
- Windows:
  - Use `.\scripts\setup_windows.ps1` to create/repair C:\uls_env and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
  - Use `.\scripts\run_tool.ps1` to execute `run_screening.py` with default paths, printing report locations
  - Optional `run.bat` for double-click execution (calls the two scripts)
- macOS/Linux:
  - Use `scripts/setup_unix.sh` to create/repair `~/.uls_env` and install requirements
  - Use `scripts/run_tool.sh` to execute with defaults and print artifact paths

## Contracts and Constraints
- Do not modify global Python or create nested venvs in repo
- Always prefer repo-relative input/output paths
- Keep `run_screening.py` behavior intact

## Validation Steps (Smoke)
1) Run setup script (Windows): `.\scripts\setup_windows.ps1`
2) Run tool script: `.\scripts\run_tool.ps1`
3) Expect:
   - `results/validation_report.html`
   - `results/validation_results.json`
   - `results/sorted_pdfs/{include,exclude}/` folders populated when PDFs present

## Troubleshooting Guidance
- Python not found: install from python.org or check `py -V`
- Script policy blocked: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`
- Pip not recognized: re-run setup script to repair pip within venv
- Long path / ensurepip errors: the C:\uls_env path avoids these issues

## Test Plan (for test-generator agent)

Write focused pytest unit tests and small integration checks:

1) Parser tests (`scripts/search_parser.py`)
- Quoted phrases: terms like "exact phrase" become regex with word boundaries
- Wildcards: stem* → \bstem\w*
- Multiple blocks: headers recognized; empty file raises ValueError

2) Validator tests (`scripts/validator.py`)
- AND logic: all blocks must pass; OR logic: any block passes
- Block combinations: combine special blocks using AND/OR; verify combined name
- Empty text: returns overall_result=False with error set

3) Extractor tests (`scripts/pdf_extractor.py`)
- Capability reporting: returns correct availability string when neither library is present (mock imports)
- No PDFs in input directory: extract_pdfs_to_json returns 0 and prints a warning
- Corrupt PDF file: extraction catches and reports failure; processed_count reflects successes only (use a dummy non-PDF renamed .pdf)

4) Reporter tests (`scripts/report_generator.py`)
- Folder creation: include/exclude folders are created before copying
- Report filename: validation_report.html is written
- Summary stats file created and contains expected fields

5) CLI smoke tests
- With empty `input_pdfs/`: script should warn “No PDF or JSON files found” and exit non-zero in prerequisites (can be simulated by pointing to a temp empty dir)
- With pre-extracted JSONs only: skips extraction and proceeds to validation
- With PDFs present: creates results/validation_report.html and results/validation_results.json

6) Cross-OS checks (docs-level and optional CI)
- Ensure scripts are executable on Unix (`chmod +x`), and Quick Start references are correct
- Verify Windows runners accept parameters and default paths

Edge cases to include:
- Missing `search_terms.txt`: prerequisites fail with a clear message
- Missing `config.json`: falls back to defaults but continues
- Non-UTF-8 content: ensure reading uses UTF-8 and handles gracefully
- Large PDFs: ensure extractor loops without excessive memory usage (qualitative)
