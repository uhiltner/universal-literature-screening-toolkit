Dear JOSS Editors,

I am pleased to submit my manuscript, "Universal Literature Screening Toolkit: A Domain-Agnostic Tool for Automated, Reproducible Literature Screening," for consideration for publication in the *Journal of Open Source Software*.

The Universal Literature Screening Toolkit (ULST) is a Python application I designed to address a critical and often underestimated bottleneck in systematic literature reviews: the screening of documents from sources with limited or non-existent advanced search capabilities. While platforms like Scopus or Web of Science allow for complex Boolean search strings, researchers frequently rely on gray literature or documents from institutional repositories where such functionality is absent. This forces them into a time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone manual screening process.

My software provides a direct solution by enabling researchers to apply a sophisticated, multi-term search protocol to any local collection of PDF documents. The ULST is deterministic, using a keyword-based validation engine to ensure that every document is evaluated against the exact same objective criteria. This not only accelerates the screening process but, more importantly, enforces a rigorous and reproducible methodology that aligns with the principles of PRISMA.

The software is designed for immediate use by researchers, regardless of their programming experience. It features a comprehensive test suite, multi-level documentation (including a `QUICK_START.md` guide for beginners), and streamlined setup scripts for both Windows and Unix-based systems.

I believe the Universal Literature Screening Toolkit represents a significant contribution to the ecosystem of research software. It fills a distinct methodological gap, empowering researchers to conduct more robust, transparent, and efficient evidence synthesis. The software is fully open source under an MIT license and is hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/uhiltner/universal-literature-screening-toolkit](https://github.com/uhiltner/universal-literature-screening-toolkit).

Thank you for considering my submission. I look forward to the review process.

Sincerely,
