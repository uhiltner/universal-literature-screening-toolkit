For management planning, information on site-specific long-term responses to CC as well as the consequences for protection functions is particularly crucial. We used the process-based model ForClim to provide projections of forest development and their protective function as decision support for a large forest enterprise in the Northern Pre-Alps. Specifically, we investigated the impact of three climate scenarios (present climate, low- and high-impact CC) at five representative sites along an elevational gradient (700–1450 m a.s.l.). Relatively small changes to current forest structure and composition were evident under present climate, but divergent trajectories occurred under CC: while the low-elevation sites (≤ 1000 m) were affected by drought-related mortality, high-elevation sites benefited from the warming. Changes at low-elevation sites were accompanied by shifts in species composition, favouring in particular Tilia (‘low-impact’ CC) and Pinus sylvestris (‘high- impact’ CC). Forest management accelerated the shift towards climate-adapted tree species, thereby reducing detrimental effects of the ‘low-impact’ CC scenario. Under the ‘high-impact’ scenario, however, drastic decreases in protective function occurred for the late twenty-first century at low elevations. A set of exemplary disturbance scenarios (windthrow and bark beetle) demonstrated the importance of forest management and low browsing for the resilience of mountain forests. Overall, our results underline the potential of process-based forest models as decision support tools for forest enterprises, providing local projections of CC impacts across large elevational ranges at the site-specific resolution required by forest managers. Keywords Mountain forest · Climate change impacts · Switzerland · Dynamic vegetation model · Ungulate browsing Introduction The increasing impacts of climate change on forests world- wide (e.g. Allen et al. 2010) have brought forest managers in the difficult position to balance multiple demands for forest ecosystem services (ES, e.g. timber production, biodiversity, recreation) in the face of uncertainties about the degree of future climate change (e.g. Yousefpour et al. 2017). Main- taining the multitude of ES under climate change is particu- larly important for mountain forests, which provide impor- tant ES for the mountain regions themselves [e.g. protection functions against gravitational hazards, Elkin et al. (2013), Irauschek et al. (2017a)] as well as downstream (EEA 2010; Langner et al. 2017). Climate change impacts on mountain forests can be highly heterogeneous in space, i.e. varying in particular with elevation and local topography (Lindner et al. 2010). While low-elevation valley bottoms are likely to become Communicated by Rüdiger Grote.

However, high spatial heterogeneity (e.g. in terms of topography) and local site and stand condi- tions (e.g. soil conditions, species composition) can super- impose these larger-scale trends (Lindner et al. 2010) and potentially lead to complex, site-specific forest responses to climate change (e.g. Etzold et al. 2019). Previous studies providing climate change impact assessments for mountain forest managers therefore emphasized the importance of local site and stand conditions at a relatively fine scale and high resolution (Irauschek et al. 2017a; Klopcic et al. 2017; Mina et al. 2017b). The rising awareness of the importance of mountain for- ests and their multiple ES has induced an increasing research interest in the past years (Lexer and Bugmann 2017). Due the expected extent of environmental changes (e.g. SCNAT 2016) and the long planning horizons in mountain forests, dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) have become a central tool for assessments of climate change impacts (e.g. Seidl et al. 2011a). Besides their suitability to climate change applications, a further advantage of most DVMs is their abil- ity to consider a wide range of species (Pretzsch et al. 2008) and explore the benefits of species mixtures (Forrester et al. 2017). Furthermore, various DVMs have been expanded over the last years to represent a diverse array of manage- ment techniques (e.g. Rasche et al. 2011; Lafond et al. 2014; Irauschek et al. 2017b). Altogether, these developments have substantially improved the suitability of DVMs to assess the effect of management and climate change on future forest development and ecosystem service provisioning in a moun- tain context (e.g. Maroschek et al. 2015; Mina et al. 2017a). In spite of the availability of assessments at larger (e.g. national) scales (e.g. Lexer et al. 2002; Bircher et al. 2015), still only few studies are available for mountain forests at the local scale, providing decision support at the level required by an individual forest enterprise (see, for example, Maro- schek et al. 2015). Furthermore, findings from one case study area may apply only to a limited degree to another area, particularly if environmental conditions are markedly different (see, for example, Elkin et al. 2013). Mountain for- est managers thus face the challenge to estimate how stud- ies from other regions or assessments at larger scales apply to their specific enterprise, and they may therefore benefit significantly from DVM assessments that account for the specific local conditions within their forest enterprise. Initiated and co-developed by the local forest manager, we provide and evaluate the utility of a DVM applica- tion for decision support in a large forest enterprise in the Northern Pre-Alps (the Oberallmeindkorporation Schwyz, OAK-SZ) in Switzerland. The study area covers a large environmental gradient from drought-affected sub-mon- tane to currently temperature-limited sub-alpine stands. As in many other mountain regions of Europe, a primary goal of forest management in the OAK-SZ is to maintain their protection function against gravitational hazards, in particular against rockfall and avalanches (see also Bebi et al. 2016). While some stands may benefit from a warm- ing under a moderate climate change scenario, a higher frequency and intensity of extreme drought events may reverse this trend and cause abrupt changes up to the point of complete forest dieback (Allen et al. 2015), with poten- tially fatal consequences for the forests’ protection func- tion (Elkin et al. 2013; Bebi et al. 2016). An aspect of particular importance for forest management is therefore whether stands are more likely to change in a gradual or abrupt way, and at which time horizons these changes are to be expected (Temperli et al. 2012). Besides the direct effects of altered temperature and precipitation, further climate-related processes are likely to impact future forest development, most notably overstorey disturbances [e.g. bark beetle outbreaks, Temperli et al. (2013), Seidl et al. (2017)] as well as intensified browsing pressure due to high ungulate populations (Côté et al. 2004; Schulze et al. 2014). The purpose of this study is therefore to address a set of stakeholder-defined management questions at a high local resolution within the forest enterprise, which thus comple- ments larger-scale assessments (Bircher et al. 2015) and results from local-scale studies from other mountain areas (e.g. Irauschek et al. 2017a; Mina et al. 2017a). Due to its particular location in an area of steep environmental gradi- ents from water-limited to temperature-limited forests, the study furthermore provides an informative case for other managed mountain forests in the Northern Alps, where con- trasting climate change impacts can be expected to occur along elevational gradients (cf. Lexer and Bugmann 2017). Using the DVM ForClim (Bugmann 1996; Huber 2019), which has been developed for climate change applications in mountain forests of the Central European Alps, we addressed the following research questions, which were defined as the basis for long-term planning and future decision-making by the local forest manager: (1) Where are the largest changes to be expected in terms of basal area and species composition for two contrasting climate change scenarios (‘low’ and ‘high impact’)? (2) When are changes in structure and composition to be expected? Are these changes gradual or abrupt? (3) Which effect will large-scale disturbances (windthrow, bark beetles) have at spruce-dominated sites under a ‘high-impact’ climate scenario? How is post-distur- bance recovery affected by previous forest management and the level of ungulate browsing? 485 European Journal of Forest Research (2020) 139:483–498 1 3 Methods Forest model ForClim ForClim is a climate-sensitive dynamic vegetation model developed for short- and long-term simulation of forest dynamics (Bugmann 1996). It belongs to the group of ‘for- est gap models’, which simulate forest properties emerging from individual-level interactions under the influence of site-specific environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, precipitation, topography, soil conditions, etc.). A forest is represented by multiple small patches, with the patch size equivalent to the area dominated by a single large tree individual (Botkin et al. 1972) based on the concept of patch dynamics (Watt 1947). Within each patch, tree demography is simulated explicitly at annual time steps in the form of establishment, growth and mortality of tree cohorts (i.e. groups of trees of the same species and age, Bugmann 1996). Environmental effects on tree growth are represented via growth-reduction factors, i.e. environ- mental conditions that deviate from the optimum reduce species-specific growth (see also Bugmann 2001). ForClim has been applied across various temperate for- ests in Europe and other parts of the world (e.g. Gutierrez et al. 2016; Mina et al. 2017a, b; Huber et al. 2018) and undergone thorough evaluation under a wide range of spe- cies and site conditions (Rasche et al. 2012; Huber 2019). Over the past decade, the capacities of ForClim to repre- sent forest management have been continuously expanded and evaluated in several mountain regions across Europe (Rasche et al. 2011; Mina et al. 2017a). All simulations of this study were conducted with ForClim Version 4.0.1 (Huber 2019); see Online Resource 1 for further details. Study areas Within the planning unit of the ‘Oberallmeindkorpora- tion Schwyz’ (subsequently abbreviated as OAK-SZ), five sites were selected (Fig. 1) to represent (1) the most frequent forest communities (Ellenberg and Klötzli 1972) per elevation zone (see Table 1) which were characteristic for the forest enterprise and (2) stands in the timber stage of development (i.e. dominant DBH > 30 cm), which had highest priority from a forest management perspective. The study region is located in the Northern Alps and fea- tures a pronounced precipitation gradient over a relatively short distance, ranging from moderate annual precipitation amounts of ca. 1100 mm at the south-eastern part of Lake Lucerne to > 2000 mm in the valleys in its east and north- east (HADES 2015). Furthermore, soil conditions differ considerably among the sites due to distinct differences in climate, geology, vegetation and topography (particu- larly slope angle). While the study sites Brünischart (BS) and Fronwald (FW) are characterized by relatively low soil water holding capacity (SWHC) due to steep slopes and shallow soil depth on calcareous bedrock (Hantke and Kuriger 2003), deeper soils with a higher SWHC occur at higher elevations, i.e. the study site of Herrenwald (HW), Tröliger Wald (TW) and Schwarz Stock (SSt, see Table 1). In terms of species composition, the lowest elevation site BS is characterized by a broadleaf-dominated forest, while the higher-elevation sites are dominated by coniferous spe- cies (particularly Abies alba and Picea abies, see Table 1 for details). The stand structure of each site was measured within 1 ha plots during July to September 2018, with the exception of FW (Riemenstalden site 01-053.001, Schwit- ter 2006), where data were provided by the Experimen- tal Forest Management project under the lead of David I. Forrester (Forrester et al. 2019). Details about the stand initialisation are provided in Online Resource 1. Small‑scale ‘mountain forest plentering’ silviculture Forest management in mountain regions is particularly difficult, since management options become increasingly constrained towards higher elevations and promoting suf- ficient regeneration is a considerable challenge (Schwitter 2013). The management technique of ‘mountain forest plentering’ (MFP) silviculture has been developed to cope with the specific situation in mountain forests, in particu- lar to induce regeneration (Schwitter 2013; Leuch et al. 2017). MFP represents a small-scale removal of collec- tives of trees (rather than individual trees as done in low- land plenter forests, Schwitter 2013) with the objective to foster regeneration via improved light and temperature conditions at the forest floor (Leuch et al. 2017). A new MFP management module was therefore designed for ForClim to harvest tree collectives in small patches of 400 m2 (i.e. the ForClim patch size in this study) within the forest. Although not being spatially explicit, this routine mimics the approach underlying cable yarding, where the goal is to remove a pre-defined fraction of the standing volume per stand. The harvest intensity is therefore defined as the target timber volume ­(VolTarget), representing the fraction of volume within the entire stand (i.e. all patches) to be harvested per intervention. Besides, a species-specific target diameter ­(DBHTarget) has to be defined by the user, representing the diameter threshold above which trees can be harvested. Furthermore, the time interval between the management interventions has to be defined by the user. The MFP module assures that scheduled harvest interventions are only carried out if sufficient harvestable volume (i.e. the prescribed ­VolTarget) is available in the entire stand (i.e. 486 European Journal of Forest Research (2020) 139:483–498 1 3 all patches) to mimic the situation that expensive moun- tain forest harvest interventions are only conducted if the intervention is cost-effective, i.e. sufficient timber can be harvested. If sufficient harvestable timer is available for the intervention, the module progressively harvests all trees within randomly chosen patches above the user- defined ­DBHTarget, thus creating gaps with favourable light conditions for regeneration while not removing the regeneration that is present already (if any, so-called advance regeneration). Notably, the module assures that the same patch is only harvested once per rotation cycle, i.e. a patch is not harvested in two consecutive interven- tions as long as other unharvested patches are available. Further details about the MFP module can be found in Online Resource 1. All MFP management interventions were scheduled at 20-year intervals for all sites, starting from 2019. The management prescriptions differed between the lower- elevation sites (BS and FW) and the higher-elevation sites (HW, TW and SSt) accounting for the different conditions along the elevation gradient. For the lower-elevation sites, all interventions were carried out with the same man- agement intensity ­(VolTarget of 15%) for all harvest inter- ventions, applying a ­DBHTarget of 40 cm for Picea abies and 60 cm for all other species. For the higher-elevation sites, a higher intensity intervention was carried out in the first harvest year 2019 ­(VolTarget of 25%), followed by lower intensity harvests ­(VolTarget of 15%) in the subse- quent interventions. At the high elevations, a ­DBHTarget of 12 cm was defined for all species.

Hillshade map © Swisstopo 487 European Journal of Forest Research (2020) 139:483–498 1 3 Calculation of ecosystem services Changes in aboveground biomass, species composition and forest structure were measured in terms of basal area ­(m2 ha−1), and protection against gravitational hazards was calculated as dimensionless protection indices, i.e. avalanche protection index (API) and rockfall protection index (RFPI), developed by Elkin et al. (2013) and Schmid (2014) based on Frehner et al. (2005). The API contains an interception component (calculated from stand leaf area index, LAI, and the relative share of coniferous trees in the stand) and a sta- bility component associated with stem density (based on the number of trees with a DBH > 8 cm). The resulting index varies between 0 and 100, with an API of 100 representing maximum protection. The RFPI is based on stem density and diameter distribution, which determines the capacity of the stand to protect against rocks of certain sizes. For the present study, a collective index was calculated for all rock size classes, as described in Schmid (2014). As for the avalanche protection index, the RFPI index varies between 0 (no protection) and 100 (max. protection function). Further details and formulae are given in Online Resource 1. Simulation scenarios Simulations of future forest dynamics were conducted for present climate and two contrasting climate change scenarios that represented a ‘low-impact’ scenario (RCP3PD, com- pliant to the targets of the Paris Agreement) and a ‘high- impact’ scenario (A2, i.e. unabated emissions), based on the CH2011 report for Switzerland (CH2011). For present climate conditions, the time series from 1931 to 2017 from the WSL database of spatially interpolated climate data derived using DAYMET (Thornton et al. 1997) was applied (cf. Online Resource 1). The ‘low-impact’ scenario features a moderate increase in annual mean temperature by + 1.5 °C and decrease in annual precipitation sum by − 10% until the end of the twenty-first century (relative to the baseline period of 1980–2011), while the ‘high-impact’ scenario rep- resents a temperature increase by + 4 °C and precipitation decrease of − 25% (CH2011). Further details about the cli- mate change scenarios are provided in Online Resource 1. Furthermore, two contrasting scenarios for ungulate browsing pressure (‘low browsing’ and ‘high browsing’) were considered in the simulation setup, since browsing damage to tree regeneration is a considerable problem in many mountain forests (Kupferschmid et al. 2015). Brows- ing in ForClim affects the density and species composition of tree regeneration, depending on browsing pressure and a species-specific browsing tolerance (Didion et al. 2011, see also Online Resource 1, section ‘Browsing scenarios’ for details).

All simulations were run for 150 years, as in Mina et al. (2017b). Since close-to-nature forestry is an important management guideline in many parts of Europe (Bauhus et al. 2013), simulations determin- ing the potential natural vegetation (PNV) at each site were conducted to provide additional information on this ‘natural reference state’ for forest management. These simulations were run for 1000 years under all climate scenarios, in the absence of management, and under a low browsing pressure. In addition to the direct effects of temperature and pre- cipitation changes, climate change is also likely to lead to intensified disturbance regimes (Seidl et al. 2017). Since predicting the exact timing of disturbance occurrence is practically impossible (Mina et al. 2017b), we investigated forest dynamics following a set of exemplary large-scale disturbances by windthrow and bark beetle outbreaks, two key disturbance types in Central European forests (Seidl et al. 2011b). These simulations were carried out for the site TW (1350 m), a typical mature, spruce-dominated stand that is structurally prone to both windthrow and bark beetle disturbances. To evaluate the effects of the timing of disturbance occurrence under a strong warming scenario, exemplary disturbance scenarios were simulated under the ‘high-impact’ climate change scenario for the years 2030 and 2070 with and without pre-disturbance management (cf. Online Resource 1 for detailed information). All results refer to forest structure and composition at the end of the simulation period (year 2150), unless stated otherwise. The simulations were carried out with ForClim version 4.0.1 (Huber 2019), and all analyses and visualisa- tions were carried out with R Version 3.4.3 (R Development Core Team 2017). Results Elevation‑specific magnitude of changes in structure and composition For the ‘low-impact’ climate scenario, only small changes in basal area, but noticeable shifts in species composition occurred across the five sites until 2150 (Fig. 2). Species shifts were most pronounced at the sites ≤ 1000 m a.s.l. (i.e. BS and FW), where warmth-adapted broadleaved species (particularly Fagus sylvatica and Tilia cordata) increased in abundance. Higher-elevation sites experienced an increase Fig. 2 Stand basal area under the ‘Low-impact’ climate scenario (RCP3PD) at the five study sites for unmanaged (top row) and man- aged (bottom row) conditions. ‘Present state’ refers to measured ini- tial state at year 2018, ‘Future state’ (with ‘low’ and ‘high’ brows- ing pressure) refers to stand state at simulation year 2150, and ‘PNV’ refers to potential natural vegetation establishing after a simulation time of 1000 years under novel climatic conditions (only for unman- aged conditions) 489 European Journal of Forest Research (2020) 139:483–498 1 3 in Fagus sylvatica, partly at the expense of Picea abies (e.g. site SSt). The PNV simulations for BS and FW (Fig. 2, top row) showed that these trends indicate a long-term shift in species dominance. Simulations including forest management (Fig. 2, bot- tom row) showed a higher share of early successional spe- cies (e.g. Betula pendula) as well as a shift towards more thermophilic broadleaved species in the regeneration layer (e.g. Fagus and Acer, Online Resource 3, Fig. A3.14ff.), representing an earlier transition towards a species compo- sition in equilibrium with climate (see PNV results). How- ever, this transition in the regeneration layer was inhibited by high browsing pressure (Fig. 2, ‘high browsing pressure’; cf. Online Resource 3), which reduced basal area and substan- tially reduced regeneration density (Online Resource A3, e.g. Fig. A3.15). For the ‘high-impact’ climate scenario, drastic reduc- tions in basal area occurred for the lower-elevation sites BS and FW, while the other sites located at higher eleva- tions increased in basal area until the year 2150 (Fig. 3, top row). For BS, the previously broadleaf-dominated stand experienced a complete transition to a Pinus sylves- tris-dominated woodland, which featured low basal area (< 15 m2 ha−1) and was characterized by low densities of large trees (> 30 cm DBH), particularly under ‘high browsing’ conditions (Online Resource 3, Fig. A3.3 and Fig. A3.5). In terms of species composition, all other sites showed increasing shares of broadleaved trees (particu- larly Tilia for the site FW and Fagus at the other sites). Simulations including forest management showed higher shares of these species in the regeneration layer (Fig. 3 and Online Resource 3, Fig. A3.9ff.) and, by the year 2150, were closer to the PNV composition (Fig. 3). These climate-induced changes affected the basal area and protection function of all sites, although the magni- tudes of change differed between the two climate scenarios (Fig. 4, Online Resource 2, Fig. A2.4–2.6). For the ‘low- impact’ climate scenario, only slight decreases in basal area resulted for the low-elevation sites (BS and FW), and higher basal area as well as rockfall and avalanche protec- tion for the high-elevation sites (Fig. 4). These patterns were much more pronounced for the ‘high-impact’ sce- nario, where basal area and protection functions decreased dramatically for the low-elevation sites. At the high-ele- vation sites, basal area as well as rockfall and avalanche protection increased. In general, similar patterns emerged under either browsing scenarios, although the magnitude of changes was higher in the ‘high browsing pressure’ scenario, particularly for avalanche protection (Fig. 4 and Online Resource 2, Fig. A2.4–2.6). Fig. 3 Stand basal area under the ‘High-impact’ climate scenario (A2) at the five study sites for unmanaged (top row) and managed (bottom row) conditions. ‘Present state’ refers to measured initial state at year 2018, ‘Future state’ (with ‘low’ and ‘high’ browsing pressure) refers to stand state at simulation year 2150, and ‘PNV’ refers to potential natural vegetation establishing after a simulation time of 1000 years under novel climatic conditions (only for unman- aged conditions) 490 European Journal of Forest Research (2020) 139:483–498 1 3 Temporal patterns of change Temporal patterns of change in basal area differed sub- stantially between the five sites and among the two climate change scenarios and were consistent for unmanaged (Fig. 5) and managed stands (Online Resource 3, Fig. A3.4ff.). While the ‘low-impact’ climate scenario showed only grad- ual changes until the year 2150, abrupt changes occurred under the ‘high-impact’ climate scenario for the low-eleva- tion sites BS and FW. Furthermore, the onset of a decreas- ing trend for BS and FW differed between the climate sce- narios: for the ‘low-impact’ scenario, basal area remained nearly constant until 2080, whereas it started to decrease already around 2050 for the ‘high-impact’ scenario (Fig. 5). Moreover, abrupt changes in basal area under the ‘high- impact’ scenario occurred at different time points depending on the site. While BS experienced an abrupt dieback already by 2060–2080, the site FW experienced a strong drought- related decrease only towards the end of the twenty-first cen- tury, and to a smaller extent (Fig. 5 and Online Resource 2, Table A2.1, Fig. A2.9). Disturbance effects Both exemplary disturbance simulations for windthrow and bark beetle at the spruce-dominated site TW (1350 m) under a ‘high-impact’ climate scenario had a similarly drastic effect, reducing stand basal area to < 10 m2 per ha (Fig. 6 and Online Resource 3, Fig. A3.26ff.). The reduc- tion in stand basal area was higher when the disturbances occurred earlier (i.e. in 2030 compared to 2080), which was due to a lower abundance of advance regeneration prior to year 2030 (Online Resource 3, Fig. A3.26 and Fig. A3.30). Furthermore, tree regeneration and growth benefited more from the warmer conditions prevailing in 2080 compared to 2030, leading to a faster recovery of basal area (Fig. 6). The recovery was, however, substantially impeded by high browsing pressure (Fig. 6). Regarding the effect of pre-disturbance forest manage- ment, basal area was up to 30% higher at the end of the first decade after disturbance if the stand had previously been managed by mountain forest plentering than if no manage- ment had been conducted (Fig. 7 and Online Resource 2, Fig. A2.7). This was due to a higher abundance of advance regeneration in the managed stands, which contributed sub- stantially to post-disturbance recovery (Online Resource A3, cf. Fig. A3.26 and Fig. A3.28). The legacy effect of previous management decreased with time since disturbance, but high browsing pressure continued to shape the trajectory of long- term recovery (Fig. 6 and Online Resource 2, Fig. A2.8). Discussion Our results showed contrasting responses to climate change along the elevational gradient within the forest enterprise, with negative impacts likely to occur at the lower-elevation sites (≤ 1000 m a.s.l.), whereas higher-elevation sites are more likely to benefit from warmer conditions in the absence of disturbances. In contrast to the ‘low-impact’ climate sce- nario, abrupt negative impacts occurred for low-elevation sites under the ‘high-impact’ scenario from the mid-twenty- first century onwards, leading to substantial shifts in species composition and stand structure as well as a severe loss of protection function. Following our research questions, we first discuss (1) the elevation-specific magnitude of change and (2) their temporal dynamics, including the response to Fig. 4 Changes in basal area, rockfall protection (RFP) and avalanche protection (AP) index for all sites at year 2150 under the ‘low-impact’ (RCP3PD) and ‘high-impact’ (A2) scenario relative to present cli- mate. Colours indicate the direction of change (red: decrease, blue: increase). Note that results shown here refer to the ‘with manage- ment’ and ‘high browsing’ simulations. Results for the ‘no manage- ment’ and ‘low browsing’ simulations feature similar patterns and are provided in Online Resource 2 491 European Journal of Forest Research (2020) 139:483–498 1 3 the exemplary disturbance scenarios. Ultimately, we discuss (3) the limitations of this study and further capabilities of DVMs to provide decision support for forest managers. Elevation‑specific magnitude of change Elevation and topography are key factors altering the local climate in mountain landscapes due to, for example, the tem- perature gradient with elevation, orographic rainfall and var- ying incident solar irradiation with aspect and slope (White- man 2000; Zou et al. 2007). The five stands of our study were located across a gradient from drought-prone, steep south-facing sites at lower-elevation to moist, north-facing sites at high elevation. These contrasting conditions were reflected in the differential climate change impacts, with det- rimental effects predominating at the two low-elevation sites with southerly aspect (BS and FW). Empirical studies from dry inner-alpine valleys in Central Europe show similar pat- terns under contemporary climate change, i.e. significantly higher drought-induced mortality at elevations < 1000 m (Minerbi et al. 2006; Rigling et al. 2013) and decreased regeneration densities on low-elevation south-facing slopes Fig. 5 Development of basal area over time under the ‘low-impact’ (RCP3PD) and ‘high-impact’ (A2) scenario, shown as the difference to the respective trajectory under present climatic conditions for the five study sites under unmanaged conditions Fig. 6 Post-disturbance recovery of basal area for the exemplary bark beetle and windthrow disturbance scenarios at the site TW (1350 m). Different colours indicate the different time point of disturbance occurrence (2030 or 2080). Different line types indicate the browsing intensity. Simulations assumed a ‘high-impact’ (A2) climate change scenario without pre-disturbance management 492 European Journal of Forest Research (2020) 139:483–498 1 3 (e.g. Wohlgemuth and Moser 2018). However, the compari- son of the simulated climate change impacts for the site BS with the results from dry inner-alpine valleys is restricted by the distinctly different climatic conditions between the respective regions (e.g. Elkin et al. 2013). At the site BS, high precipitation amounts during summer prevent severe droughts under present climate conditions (see Online Resource 2, Fig.A2.9) and permit the growth of a mixed deciduous forest with relatively high basal area in spite of the low soil water holding capacity (ATRAGENE 1997). Nevertheless, our simulation results indicate that a number of severe droughts under future climate change may change the situation rapidly and emphasize the particular vulner- ability of the low-elevation, south-facing site BS among the gradient of simulated sites within the forest enterprise. This site-specific response exemplifies the challenge that mountain forest managers are facing and shows how DVMs can provide decision support for forest planning with a local resolution. On the one hand, large-scale assessments pro- vide important information on climate change impacts (e.g. Bugmann et al. 2014; Bircher et al. 2015; SCNAT 2016), which may, however, not be at a sufficiently detailed level for mountain forest enterprises located in topographically complex and environmentally contrasting settings. As shown by the recent empirical study by Etzold et al. (2019), pat- terns of climate-induced forest mortality in Switzerland are highly complex and depend on the combination of species effects and small-scale site conditions. An evaluation based on species composition alone may, for instance, conclude that the stand BS (dominated by drought-tolerant oak and pine) would be more resistant to drought impacts than FW (dominated by the less drought-tolerant Abies alba and Picea abies, e.g. Leuschner and Meier 2018). While the ‘low-impact’ climate scenario indeed caused little change in forest structure and composition at BS, the ‘high-impact’ climate scenario induced drastic diebacks at this site, despite the predominance of drought-tolerant species. In contrast, the higher-elevation site FW was less impacted despite the predominance of more drought-sensitive conifers. Our study thus supports the findings of context-specific climate change impacts, which depend strongly on the specific abiotic and biotic conditions (Condes and del Rio 2015; Sanchez-Sal- guero et al. 2015; Etzold et al. 2019). The simulated ‘high-impact’ climate change effects at low elevations have pronounced consequences for the services provided by the respective stands, since the decrease in basal area implies a loss of harvestable timber as well as a severe loss of protection function against gravitational hazards. In the absence of a continuous forest cover, avalanche release risk is substantially higher since the forest cover decreases snowpack depth (due to higher snow interception), alters microclimatic conditions and increases surface roughness Fig. 7 Basal area at the end of the first decade after disturbance in 2080 for the two exemplary disturbance scenarios (windthrow and bark beetle) under low and high browsing, as well as managed (‘WithMng’) and unmanaged (‘NoMng’) conditions at the site TW (1350 m). Results for the disturbance in year 2030 are shown in Fig. A2.5 (Online Resource A2) 493 European Journal of Forest Research (2020) 139:483–498 1 3 (Frehner et al. 2005). Similarly, rockfall risk increases dras- tically as stands formerly characterized by a large range of size and densities lose their well-structured characteristics (Dorren et al. 2005). According to Bebi et al. (2016), the importance of rockfall (as well as landslides and erosion) is expected to increase more than the importance of avalanches under climate change. Although the seasonal time window with critical snowcover for avalanches is likely to decrease with climate change, avalanche risks at lower elevations should not be underestimated, particularly regarding snow- gliding on steep south-facing slopes (Bebi et al. 2016), e.g. at the site BS. In the case of rockfall, an adaption towards a coppice management could, however, diminish this increas- ing risk and improve the protective function of the lower-ele- vation, broadleaf-dominated forests (e.g. Radtke et al. 2014). An additional level of decision support that can be pro- vided by a DVM-based approach is the local-scale compo- sition of potential natural vegetation (PNV), which repre- sents the emerging species compositions under novel climate conditions. Although the drastic dieback at the site BS was projected to lead to very low basal areas for the end of the twenty-first century, the PNV simulations imply that a Pinus sylvestris forest would re-establish in the long term even under a ‘high-impact’ climate scenario. It is, however, pos- sible that besides Pinus sylvestris, more drought-tolerant sub-Mediterranean tree species could immigrate at the low-elevation BS site in the future, such as pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens), which is becoming an increasingly important tree species in dry central Alpine valleys (Rigling et al. 2013). As recently demonstrated by Huber (2019), the immigration of more climate-adapted species could play an important role in buffering negative impacts of climate change. Altogether, the combination of insights from empiri- cal studies (e.g. Frank et al. 2017, Wohlgemuth et al. 2018) as well as from DVM-based assessments can thus provide important decision support regarding which tree species to favour at a specific location in the long term. In contrast to the detrimental impacts at low elevations, the ‘high-impact’ climate scenario led to increases in basal area and a shift in species composition towards more ther- mophilic broadleaved species at the high-elevation sites (> 1000 m a.s.l.). Although the increase in basal area sug- gests a positive development for forest management (i.e. provisioning of more harvestable timber), simulated spe- cies composition showed a strong discrepancy compared to the PNV simulations by the year 2150, indicating that the high fraction of Norway spruce (Picea abies) remaining in the simulated stands is unlikely to represent a climatically suitable forest composition (cf. Bugmann et al. 2014). Par- ticularly under unmanaged conditions, stand structure in the year 2150 was characterized by a high number of tall, old spruce trees, indicating a high susceptibility to windthrow (Seidl et al. 2014; Schuler et al. 2019). Furthermore, climate change likely leads to an increase in the risk of bark bee- tle outbreaks at higher elevations due to an increase in the number of generations per year and prolonged annual flight periods (Temperli et al. 2013; Bugmann et al. 2014). The advantages of increased growth may thus be counteracted by negative impacts of enhanced biotic or abiotic disturbances, as shown in our exemplary disturbance simulations. Includ- ing forest management in our simulations, however, induced the regeneration of more climate-adapted species (particu- larly Fagus and Acer) and led to a faster transition towards a less vulnerable mixed species forest at higher elevations. With respect to species responses to climate change along the elevation gradient, our simulation results showed an upslope spread of thermophilic, broadleaved species, particularly under the ‘high-impact’ climate scenario. This is in line with an increasing number of observations under contemporary climate change that are reporting an upward expansion of the distribution ranges of trees (e.g. Penuelas and Boada 2003; Vitasse et al. 2012), although species-spe- cific responses can be complex and site specific (e.g. Gazda et al. 2019). Furthermore, palaeoecological studies show similar upward shifts of broadleaved species during periods with higher temperatures, e.g. for Tilia during the Holocene temperature maximum (Thöle et al. 2016), and suggest an increase in the abundance of Fagus sylvatica at high eleva- tions under future climate change (Schwörer et al. 2014). The projected shifts of dominant species are thus in general agreement with patterns found in empirical studies of past and contemporary climate change, although the responses of some subdominant species (e.g. increase in Betula pendula at high-elevation managed sites) may be overestimated (cf., e.g. Wohlgemuth and Moser 2018). Temporal patterns of change Estimating the most likely pathway of future climate change is difficult due to uncertainties in the future of socio-eco- nomic and technological developments (IPCC 2013). While trajectories of temperature changes show relatively small differences between the emission scenarios in the first half of the twenty-first century, they differ substantially until the end of the century for Switzerland (CH2011). A similar trend was evident from the simulated forest properties, with little change until around 2040, but substantial differences between the climate change scenarios thereafter. The rates of change are of particular importance in this context (cf., Reyer et al. 2015), tending to be gradual for the ‘low-impact’ scenario, but more abrupt for the ‘high-impact’ scenario at sites ≤ 1000 m a.s.l. While the specific time points of these drastic changes are subject to considerable uncertainty, several studies suggest a much higher probability and fre- quency of drought events in the twenty-first century (e.g. Dai 2013). The combination of higher temperatures and 494 European Journal of Forest Research (2020) 139:483–498 1 3 lower precipitation is likely to lead to tipping point dynam- ics, resulting in sudden drought-related tree mortality (Allen et al. 2015). The risk of this sudden dieback is particularly high for tree species currently growing under unsuitable climatic conditions, as shown, e.g. for Picea abies at low elevations (e.g. Levesque et al. 2013). In accordance with these findings, our results suggest that a ‘high-impact’ cli- mate change scenario leads to a much higher risk of rapid drought-related forest dieback for the late twenty-first century. If the current trend of failing to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement continues (UNEP 2019), low- to mid- elevation mountain forests may be at particular risk of drought-related tree mortality and substantial losses in their protective function against gravitational hazards. To avoid or at least mitigate this situation, forest management should particularly promote the regeneration with climate-adapted species (SCNAT 2016). Our results demonstrate how a DVM approach can provide decision support in the selec- tion of potentially suitable species and help to estimate the time span remaining for forest management to address these issues before negative changes are becoming evident in the forest. Both aspects, i.e. identifying suitable species and esti- mating available time windows for taking action, are key for enterprise-level forest planning (Streit et al. 2017). Based on the results from BS, considerable impacts of climate change are likely to be expected in our case study enterprise from around the mid-twenty-first century under a ‘high-impact’ climate scenario, suggesting that forest management has less than three decades to establish sufficient advance regenera- tion, which is a critically short time window in mountain forests (Ott et al. 1997). Besides the direct impacts of climate change on low-ele- vation sites, abiotic and biotic disturbances by windthrow and bark beetle attacks pose a threat to the spruce forests at higher elevations (Seidl et al. 2011b; Temperli et al. 2013). As demonstrated by our exemplary disturbance simula- tions, the benefit of timely forest management and reduced browsing pressure also plays a key role for post-disturbance recovery in high-elevation forests. Notably, a higher post- disturbance basal area and a faster recovery were simulated when the disturbance (windthrow or bark beetle) occurred in the late twenty-first century (year 2080), which was due to a higher abundance of advance regeneration induced by management and the additional effect of the warmer climate. These findings are supported by empirical studies, e.g. by Schwitter et al. (2015), who evaluated 24 years of forest dynamics at windthrow sites in Switzerland and found that post-disturbance recovery was much faster when advance regeneration was present in the pre-disturbance stands. This initial advantage in the first years after disturbance is of particular importance for the protection function of a for- est, since trees of a certain minimum height are required to provide protection against avalanches and rockfall (Noack et al. 2004). Furthermore, browsing pressure is a key factor that can reduce establishment and slow down post-distur- bance forest succession substantially, as shown by various empirical (e.g. Kupferschmid and Bugmann 2005) and mod- elling studies (e.g. Kupferschmid et al. 2006; Thrippleton et al. 2018). It has to be noted, however, that rather than providing a realistic projection of future forest dynamics under changing disturbance regimes, our exemplary distur- bance simulations only aimed to test the broad effects of timing of disturbance, previous management and browsing pressure on recovery. Despite these limitations, our results demonstrate at a general level that reduced browsing pres- sure and adequate forest management are key to improve for- est resilience to disturbances by windthrow and bark beetle attacks in susceptible spruce-dominated mountain forests. Using DVMs as decision support tools for mountain forest managers Our study exemplifies how a DVM can provide key insights into climate change impacts at the scale of interest of a for- est enterprise. For the present study, a relatively simple approach was applied, which requires only moderate efforts in terms of data acquisition from the forest enterprise (i.e. full calipering of a small number of representative stands). However, DVMs can provide a wealth of further decision support under changing environmental conditions [see also review by Fontes et al. (2010)] from lowland to mountain forests (e.g. Irauschek et al. 2017a; Lexer and Bugmann 2017; Gutsch et al. 2018). With respect to spatial scale, measurements of current stand structure can be obtained at high resolution and large spatial extents by combining inventory data and airborne laser scanning (LiDAR), as shown by Maroschek et al. (2015). Rather than using the spatially limited approach of representative stands, as in our study, some DVMs are capa- ble of representing the spatial arrangement of forest patches at much larger spatial scales, e.g. the models LANDIS (Mladenoff 2004), iLand (Seidl et al. 2012) or LandClim (Schumacher et al. 2004). This type of landscape models furthermore allows to simulate exogenous disturbances as self-emergent properties of the system (e.g. Seidl et al. 2014; Temperli et al. 2015), which was not possible in our stand-scale DVM. However, the increasing degree of spatial detail comes with its own challenges, e.g. a strongly increas- ing data demand [see also review by Keane et al. (2015)], which reduces the likelihood of such models being used in the absence of a dedicated and specifically funded research project. Another aspect that was not investigated in detail in this study is the use of DVMs to explore alternative forest man- agement approaches to optimize the provisioning of multiple 495 European Journal of Forest Research (2020) 139:483–498 1 3 goods and services. The capacity of DVMs to assess trade- offs and synergies between multiple ecosystem services has been addressed more recently, e.g. by studies in different mountain areas within Europe by Mina et al. (2017a) and Langner et al. (2017). An overview of the management capacities of different DVMs is given in Fontes et al. (2010), although the capabilities of some DVMs have increased con- siderably in the last years (e.g. Irauschek et al. 2017b; Mina et al. 2017b). Ultimately, multi-criteria decision analyses can be used in combination with DVM simulations to facilitate the identification of appropriate management alternatives for a wide range of forest goods and services (e.g. Wolfslehner and Seidl 2010). Overall, DVMs are increasingly suitable tools for provid- ing decision support in mountain forests. A broader coverage of studies from different mountain regions would thus be highly valuable from a forest management perspective as well as from a scientific perspective, e.g. for synthesizing overarching conclusions on the impact of climate change in mountain regions (e.g. Price et al. 2011). Conclusion Although climate change impact assessments are increas- ingly becoming available at larger (e.g. national) scales, only a few studies have focused on the climate change impacts on mountain forests at the level of a forest enterprise, tak- ing into account the combined effect of climate, specific site conditions, initial forest structure and management. Dynamic forest models are capable of accounting for these aspects and thus are promising tools to provide assessments at a relatively high local resolution, which is required by mountain forest managers. The present study demonstrates how a DVM approach can provide information on site-specific forest vulnerabil- ity, assessments of the timing and magnitude of change, quantification of changes in protective function as well as information regarding the choice of climate-adapted tree species; all these aspects are highly relevant for long-term planning within the forest enterprise. For our case study for- est enterprise, key conclusions were: (1) low-elevation sites (≤ 1000 m a.s.l.) were most vulnerable to adverse climate change impacts and should thus receive particular attention. (2) Forest management was of high importance to induce sufficient advance regeneration, which is key to ensure forest resilience and specifically the protective function in the long term. (3) Management measures must be taken in the near future (i.e. the coming 20–30 years) to avoid a severe loss of the protective function particularly under a ‘high-impact’ climate scenario. Although higher-elevation sites benefited from the warming climate, simulations for potential natural vegetation indicate that the current vegetation composition becomes climatically unsuitable, thus suggesting that risks of catastrophic disturbances (e.g. windthrow and bark bee- tle) may rise accordingly. Ultimately, the results from this study emphasize that international efforts to reach the goals of the Paris Agree- ment are of crucial importance for mountain forests, as una- bated climate change is likely to severely deteriorate for- est health as well as the services that are provided by these forests.
